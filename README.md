# pyhuh - huh? interpreter in Python 3

huh? is an esoteric programming language created by David Catt where the interpreter doesn't understand what you want it to do. Every file is a valid huh? program. The interpreter will do its best to understand the input, but will fail 100% of the time. If it doesn't understand something, it will do nothing and simply express its confusion. It is implied that every command does something, we're just not sure what. [[source](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Huh%3F)]

This is a Python 3 version of [[pythuhn](https://github.com/kade-robertson/pythuhn)], it also works on GNU/Linux, unlike pythuhn.
# Usage
```sh
./pyhuh [file]
```
